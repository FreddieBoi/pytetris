pytetris
========
**pytetris** is a Tetris clone written in **python** and **pygame**. It's old and kinda bad, but it was my first lines of python. Be nice! :)

Run **pytetris** using the command `python pytetris.py` (requires pyhton and pygame).

Controls
--------
+ **Left Arrow** - Move current figure to the left
+ **Right Arrow** - Move current figure to the right
+ **Down Arrow** - Move current figure downwards
+ **Up Arrow** - Rotate current figure
+ **Space** - Drop current figure

Distribution
------------
First, make sure **py2exe** is installed (besides **python** and **pygame** of course), then run the command `python pytetris2exe.py` to build Windows executables. Executables are outputted to a `dist` folder.
